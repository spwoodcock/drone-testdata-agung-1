# Drone Test Data Mt Agung 1

## Contents

- Images of Mt Agung, Bali, Indonesia.
- A GeoJSON AOI of the area.
- QGIS project to load and visually inspect.
- Images geopackage, to display inside QGIS easily.

## Intentional Errors

- The imagery has a few intentional errors to be caught by DroneTM processing.
- As a result I would not recommend processing via tools like ODM, without
  first removing these files.
- Some have invalid EXIF, others blurry photos, or are simply black (indicating lens cap left on).
- These files are denoted by `_ISSUE_WITH_FILE.JPG`.
